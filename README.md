# VitzCloud

## I was annoyed by our Online School's System, so I made my own!

I know that there's millions of ways to improve that thingy but idk this one has some cool features ig:  
* Custom Usernames and Avatars  
* Bio's  
* A Better uptime  
* Constant updates  
* DDoS Protection by CloudFlare

## Here's some of the cool stuff coming out soon!
* An `Explore` Page
* A User Queue so People don't spam alt accs
* A Few more bug fixes
* an API for Users

## Contribute!
Since my Coding Skills are... yeah, let's not talk about it, you are free to fork this Repo and create a Pull request.  
I will then take a look at it and will most likely merge it into a new branch
